# wmin-model
Weight Minimisation PDF-model of Colibri

## wmin-model Installation
From your base conda environment run:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
this will create a conda environment called `wmin-model-dev` that has a `wmin` executable and all the needed dependencies (e.g. `colibri`). 
To use a different environment name, one should do
```
conda env create -n myenv -f environment.yml
```
